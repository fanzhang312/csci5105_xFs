============

Implement a simple “serverless” file system based on the classic xFS paper in which peer nodes can share their files directly with other. There is a server but its role is limited. Using this system, a user can store files in their local storage to share with other users. **Load balancing** and **Fault tolerance** are emphasized in this project.
